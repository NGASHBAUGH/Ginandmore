        <h2>My Gin, Its Story, and Its Future</h2>

        <h4>First Spirit</h4>
        <p>In the fall of 2023, I received a gin tasting as a gift. I had recently created my own logo and thought of putting it on a unique, niche product made in my region: GIN.</p>
        <p>I added to the basic ingredients PINK PEPPER, which is a false pepper with phytotherapeutic properties and a mildly spicy aroma, then ARTEMISIA, a miraculous herb. I chose the latter ingredient while thinking of a dear person who has been very close to me in recent years, FAUSTO. I have always wished for a "miracle" to repay everything he has done for me over the years. Bottle no. 1 was dedicated and given to him.</p>

        <h4>Second Spirit</h4>
        <p>I decided to make a second version, adding a more refreshing, summery flavor to the first one. After researching various herbs with refreshing properties, I had the idea to add MORINGA, a plant native to India and Pakistan known for its healing properties (also called "the miracle tree"). JACOPO, another dear person to me, offered to bring me this ingredient after a trip to India.</p>

        <h4>Third Spirit</h4>
        <p>I dedicate this to my children: GIACOMO, COSTANZA, and FILIPPO, who, with their different yet similar personalities, are a source of inspiration and motivation for me every day. This is why I chose to add birch sap to the Artemisia; birch is an extraordinary plant with great purifying and beneficial properties. Birch sap, the sap of life.</p>

        <h4>The Logo</h4>
        <p>I created the logo, with the dream of turning it into a brand. Two M's... my last name, and a D that representing a heart, the heart that connects my origins, my family: MATTAI DEL MORO.</p>
